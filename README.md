# BookmarkExtension
A Chrome extension. When the extension icon is pinned, with a simple clic you can open the link needed.

At first, download all the Repo Code.
In the Repo files, change the link in the 'background.js' file and the 'icon.png' image.
Then, go on chrome (Or other Chromium-Based Browser), turn on 'Developper Settings' and Upload the Unpacked Extension.
